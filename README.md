This arcane project was conjured with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a powerful tome of web enchantment.

## 📜 Grimoire of Commands

_Invoke these incantations in the project directory to bend reality to your will:_

### 🔥 `npm start`

_Ignites the development pyre..._

Summons the app in development mode.\
Open the portal [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your scrying mirror.

The page shall reform itself when you alter the runes.\
You may also witness warnings of malformed spells in the console.

### ⚗️ `npm test`

_Examines your creation for weaknesses..._

Unleashes the test spirits in interactive watch mode.\
Consult the ancient scrolls about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for forbidden knowledge.

### ⚔️ `npm run build`

_Forges your creation for battle..._

Crafts the app for the mortal realm, creating artifacts in the `build` folder.\
It binds React in production sigils and optimizes the enchantment for maximum potency.

The build is compressed and the filenames are sealed with cryptic hashes.\
Your creation is ready to be unleashed upon the world!

Consult the dark tomes about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for guidance.

### 💀 `npm run eject`

**Warning: This ritual cannot be undone. Once you `eject`, your soul belongs to the void!**

If the binding forces displease you, you may `eject` at any time. This severing will extract the single binding dependency from your creation.

Instead, it will duplicate all configuration scrolls and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) directly into your project, granting you complete dominion. All commands except `eject` shall continue to function, but they will point to your duplicated scrolls for you to alter. At this point, you walk alone in the darkness.

You need not ever use `eject`. The curated enchantments are suitable for small and medium workings, and you should not feel compelled to use this power. However, we understand that this tool would be useless if you could not break its bonds when you are prepared for the consequences.

## 🧙‍♂️ Arcane Knowledge

You can gain deeper understanding through the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
